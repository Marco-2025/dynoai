## Inspiration
When we formed this 4 man group we spent an hour or two to brainstorm ideas together. The keyword we focused on was "interactivity", and most of our initial ideas were based on different concepts of data visualization and machine learning.

We all agreed to focus on a computer vision project. We linked multiple ideas together to build a object scanner that uses object recognition to identify the object name (e.g. if the photo provided a banana or an aluminium can). We then decided to expand this idea to hopefully link ideas of identifying whether this object is from a sustainable company. Lastly the way we presented this is in the form of a website.

## What it does
This website opens up in into the home page, asking the user to "feed Dyno" by uploading an image. Once a photo is uploaded, the website transitions to the second page. This shows the image that the user uploaded, in addition to various information related to the submitted image. It provides the name of the detected object, nutritional information (per 100g), and a rating of how sustainable the company that makes the product is (if applicable).

## How we built it
Through teamwork and collaboration, we all had skills that complemented each others'.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into several challenges mostly with getting APIs to work, such as reaching a limit for one that provides a company's sustainability. In the end, we overcame (most of) these challenges with resilience and created a working product we are proud of.

## What we learned
What's next for DynoAI
Our future plan for Dyno AI would be to continuously improve the Dyno character model by creating a 3D animated character with more animations. Some other features we would have liked to add include a bar to give a sense of scale to the company's sustainability.
